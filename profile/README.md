## Summary
Millions of people worldwide live with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, yet there are very few treatment options for those affected. One challenge facing researchers in this area is the lack of biological markers (biomarkers) that could be used to identify people in the very earliest stages of their disease; measure the effects of a potential treatment; or uncover clusters of patients who share biomarker patterns in common and may respond well to a specific treatment.
Over the years, researchers worldwide have amassed a wealth of biological samples and data that could yield vital information on biomarkers relating to neurodegenerative diseases. However, finding out what samples and data are available, then accessing and using them, is far from easy. Moreover, the rules and protocols for collecting, storing and sharing samples and data vary widely.

The aim of EPND is to establish a collaborative platform that would link up existing European research infrastructures and so speed up the discovery of new biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases.
EPND will build a secure platform via a European node on the AD Workbench of the Alzheimer’s Disease Data Initiative (ADDI). The AD Workbench is a data platform that allows researchers to share, access and analyse data. EPND will adapt the AD Workbench to support things like data storage, harmonisation and analysis; sample storage; and more. Sample and data discovery tools will be connected to a network of over 60 cohorts with Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and related disorders. Between them, these cohorts will facilitate access to samples and data from over 120 000 research participants.
Ethical and legal experts as well as patients will ensure that the rights of research participants are protected.

Beyond establishing the network, the project aims to develop principles to enable access to samples and data and establish fair and transparent governance and processes.
By the end of the project, EPND should be a self-sustaining organisation, facilitating access to biological samples and data to accelerate biomarker discovery and validation and eventually supporting the development of therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases.

## EPND 
The vision for the EPND consortium is to enable better outcomes in neurodegenerative diseases through more data and sample discovery, and sharing for research use. The EPND system is being developed to provide integrated technical services improving the ability for the neurodegenerative research community (academic and industry) to connect with cohorts with data and/or samples and then collaborate on research. 
The EPND system will be the technology layer of the European Platform for Neurodegenerative Disease.

It is designed to maximise the responsible discovery, access and use of data and samples across the public and private European neurodegenerative research community. The proposed design builds on existing infrastructure such as institutional data banks and biorepositories alongside the AD Workbench (ADWB) operated by Alzheimer’s Disease Data Initiative (ADDI). It comprises multiple component services from consortium partners in a federated architecture, with a central entry point for users. A set of interoperability standards allow the system to evolve as new technical components become available. A set of well-defined processes would enable the consolidation of a secure operational environment that is legally compliant and can be trusted by all parties including research participants and patients.
By the end of the project, the system will have been operational for some time, hosting a number of successful exemplar use cases and actively attracting further data partners and clinical research projects.
